## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Jerald Kirimo from Kenya, I do software development majoring on backend development. I am experienced in using Spring framework with excellence in analysing complex problems and breaking them down into smaller manageable tasks. I also enjoy designing using photoshop, illustator and video editing using Davinci Resolve 19. I have good mastery of SQL for database management and API documentation providing instruction for easy intergration with front end developers or other systems.
